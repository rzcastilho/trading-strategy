# RSI Mean Reversion Strategy Example (TOML Format)
# Buy oversold conditions, sell overbought conditions
#
# Strategy Logic:
# - BUY when RSI < 30 (oversold) AND price > 50-day SMA (uptrend filter)
# - SELL when RSI > 70 (overbought)
# - STOP if RSI < 25 (extreme oversold, potential breakdown)
# - Position sizing: 10% of capital per trade
